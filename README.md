# US-Accidents
This project uses the dataset called, “US Accidents (3.5 million records) A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset (2016 - 2020),” to analyze particular factors that contribute to car accidents that cause most interference in traffic. The dataset contain all sorts of information about each accident. There are a total of 2,974,335 observations with 49 variables for each observation in the dataset. Some of the variables are categorical. They mention if a particular object or road condition was present at the time of the accident or where exactly the accident occurred and the time of day. Other variables are quantitative. They mention how much of a weather related item was present during the accident, such as wind or precipitation. This study uses the ordinal variable, Severity, as a response variable. Severity assigns a value from 1 to 4 to describe how much impact the accident had on traffic with 4 being the most amount of interference and 1 being least amount of interference. In this study, we seek to find out what particular factors of car accidents are most associated with the amount of resulting traffic interference. We use the other variables in this data set to find out
